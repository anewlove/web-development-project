            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p><b>Backround</b>: My name is Avery Newlove and i'm from Roswell, Ga, but the rest of my family is from Buffalo, New York. 
                <br>I played many sports and video games growing up, which led to many of 
                my passions that I have today. <br>I am the oldest of four, having 2 sisters and one, 2 year old brother </p>
            
                <p><b>About</b>: I have a deep liking for all sports, basketball, football, Golf, etc. My favourite NFL team is the buffalo bills and my favourite NBA team is the New York Knicks.
                <br>I play golf fairly consistent and my handicap is a 10. Since I was very young I always enjoyed playing video games and working with tech. <br>When I was 13 I built my first PC,
                which is what kickstarted my passion for programming, game development, and CS as a whole.
            </p>
            <p><b>Goals</b>: My current goals for the future are to graduate with a degree in IT and pursue a career path.</p>
